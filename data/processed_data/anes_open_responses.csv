Multinationals can exact resources from the US and then move on with little to no penalty.  USA's moto: Feed Wall Street!  Instead of insuring that the richest country in the world can feed and keep healthy the citizens of the USA.   Elizabeth Warren seems to have a clear understanding of how we have allowed big corporations to change the laws to their benefit.  I would back anyone who had a logical plan to swing the pendulum back towards the citizens. I see Germany, Denmark, and New Zealand as examples of how a government should work for their citizens. Our politicians should have a global point of view and look outside of the US for these examples. I am not suggesting we adopted all of their practices but certainly they provide insight on how we could improve.",Greater funding of a education focused not just on improving critical thinking but in caring about what happens outside the borders of the United States of America!

Finally, the U.S. Supreme Court is also too ultra-polarized to objectively rule ""Constitutional"" or ""Not Constitutional"" and winds up Legislating which is in direct violation of the U.S. Constitution","How much room do I have? When government at all levels removed God, the United States' decline began. When it became illegal to say the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" in school, when ""pray"" was removed from government, schools and the public display of praying-Judaeo Christian style, the decline of the United States increased. When Socialism is taught and accepted by U.S. citizens, it demonstrates the true ignorance of people. America is about to get ""what it thinks it wants,"" but is going to lead to America's ultimate destruction. The immigration process is broken, drugs are out of control, made legal by states and are chemically killing and making Americans dependent and a burden to society. The EPA is out of control and causing America to either again become dependent on OPEC, or causing America to burn (by fire) out of control and unable to mitigate or protect against natural weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, earth quakes, fires, floods, and more).

Lack of putting God first and lack of responsibility or accountability to God Almighty! After everyone shelved God from government, school, public, from the U.S. Constitution (violation of the First Amendment), America is about to get what it does not want-the Wrath of God. However, the First Amendment ensures aesthetes and non-believers the ""right"" to say or ""do"" what they want. Unfortunately, after people said you can't include God in politics, they wrongly misunderstood the Constitution's basis for keeping government out of God, not God out of government! America needs to return to God which would curb all the unrest in America today. Unfortunately, I believe America hos moved too far away from God. But, God is just and forgiving.

There is damning evidence both factual and circumstantial (the circumstantial is overwhelming) that this election was rife with fraud, if not outright engineered for fraud.Couple that with the Left's push to abolish 2nd Amendment freedoms, (publicly stated by Biden and Harris), which is the Amendment the Founders authored as the defense against Tyrannical Government/Authoritarian Government, and this is a downright *frightening* issue.","Another important issue is the rising tide of Socialism/Communism.  Sadly, our education system and public officials are endorsing, publicly, paths and policies widely acknowledged as Socialist and in some cases, Communist. Communism has been an abject failure wherever tried, so much so that the countries that still claim it, (e.g. China, Vietnam, N. Korea, et. al) are either floundering with people starving publicly, e.g. DPRK, or the government has shifted to a form of Corporatism that only benefits those in power (e.g. China and Vietnam).  While some countries still claim to be Socialist, most have either trended toward Corporatism (which offers none of the ""benefits"" of Communism/Socialism, while giving many of the negatives of Capitalism, but still allows those in power to prosper and the people to slightly improve their standing but at a cost unacceptable anywhere else, read: China).  Sadly, it is quickly forgotten that Communism/Socialism cost in excess of 100 million of their own countrymen's lives (Ukraine's Holodomor, Stalin's Purges, Mao's Cultural Revolution + Great Leap Forward, Cambodia, et al); this is an imperative issue that must be addressed.",Governmental Over-reach/Too much power centralized in the Federal Government,The Election Fraud of 2020

I think that appointing one person to be in charge and have the country on there shoulders. We also need to stop making elections based on how much money a person can raise or has.

353933,"The Liberals, who are taking over whatever they can in our country and trying to push their own agendas. They are not in touch with what the average person wants and needs. They listen to a few radical people to make decisions. They appear to be giving in to radical ideas that just will not work, even if they are not for them, simply because of radical people or groups that are yelling the loudest, using violence or simply bold enough to confront and demand ideas that will negatively affect the average American. They use negative race and religious comments in an effort to make us feel bad and to control us. Most Americans, of every nationality, are kind and good people who help others all the time and are not racist. They are reasonable and just want to be able to work, take care of their families and be safe.","The current news media, is very biased and not willing simply to report what is going on. They work to hide what they do not want you to know and report things that are not true or are a skewed version of what is happening to control us. There is very little honest reporting going on, which makes it hard for Americans to make fair decisions about what is happening in America. It was not always like that in the past. Currently, most of the news we see or hear is giving the Liberal view, side of chosen topics and hiding other topics that it would be good for Americans to know about. Very disappointed in our media.","The current pandemic/COVID. The shutdowns, lack of income for businesses and families, illnesses and concern for spread of virus, as well as our children out of school, not ideal learning, and concern for elderly.  There are too many differing opinions on what to do from scientists, Drs and Government Officials. Restrictions put in place are not always reasonable or appropriate and often not observed by officials who put them in place. Most people are reasonable and want to do what will reduce the virus.","Take over of our Democracy by liberals. We will eventually be able to respond and handle the virus and the news media will begin to loose money because no one trusts them, not even those in control of them and Americans will force them to change or ignore them. The America we know and our freedoms will not survive becoming a socialist country, which has been proven over and over throughout history in other countries. Too bad we keep removing history from school curriculum or more liberals would know that."

The political gap between the two parties have been increasing ever so slightly to the point where both sides are willing to ignore their own faults albeit corruption, weak policies or even just scandals/controversies. I also believe that because the political gap is widening that this will lead to more and more extremists that are willing to go through with domestic terrorism on both sides. Regardless, I think this should be talked about despite people not wanting to hear about it and be made in attempts to fix this ever growing problem.",I think another important issue at hand has to deal with Immigration as I don't think a mere border wall will fix the issue to begin with as it is much larger than that.,-9,"Again, I believe it would be the Extreme Political Discourse.

In a worst case scenario ceases to be able to exist. A thriving natural, wild, environment is crucial to humans' physical, mental, and emotional well being. Climate change will, by its very nature, change the environments in which we live. Species will need to adapt, and adapt quickly, or become extinct. We are already in the midst of the 6th mass extinction our planet has known in the age, appropriately if frighteningly named: the Anthropocene. Climate change is an existential crisis. It is the most important problem facing our country and our planet.","Our current capitalist system depends on continued, growing consumption and eschews sustainability. Laws permit and government rewards wealthy and powerful organizations and companies that invest in perpetuating their own unsustainable industries. Advertising promotes consumption. Humans have become a metaphoric cancer on the planet. We need a new economic system that rewards sustainability, innovation, community participation, and supports those unable or unwilling to work. Life needs to be affordable. Currently, life in my city, Los Angeles, is barely affordable for a dual income family and yearly becomes more expensive. Some work more than 40 hours, some at multiple jobs, some barely see their families. Many have become homeless. We are in crisis. Poverty amidst massive wealth is not only disturbing, it is destabilizing. Combined with destabilizing messages from foreign countries through social media, our country is primed for social unrest, violence, and ultimately civil war. Our systems & values need to change. We need to reward behavior from individuals and companies that support equality, community, a livable environment, adequate wages, and a healthy natural environment.","Citizen's United needs to be overturned. Corporation are not people. Most humans have compassion and empathy whereas corporations do not, moreover, most corporations cannot afford to make decisions that are not in the economic interest of their investors even if those decisions result in damage to the environment and communities they serve. The 'dark money' flooding our media has damaged our society and skewed our elections. Allowing corporations to act without consideration and concern for their actions', products', and services' effect on the environment, the natural world, and humans, is irresponsible and damaging to our country overall.",Climate change.

Both issues encompass the failing dynamic of most pertinent problems in the world, many of which are absolutely heartbreaking.","Educational, judicial and monetary systems, deplorable treatment of vets, monetary gain is more valued than the fairness, health and well being in a myriad of issues pertaining to the citizens of this country.","My last 2 answers encompass many, many topics.  I'm apprehensive to single out too much as I think they all are correlated w/ my last 2 answers as well as my 1st responses of main issues w/ communication, mutual mindfulness, mutual respect and productive education to create the best balance to deriving solutions out of intellect w/ compassion and empathy as well as the in between process of coming up w/ those solutions. Basic foundations seem to be missing in issue correcting.","The manner in which the majority handle communicating.  Regardless who you are, where you are or what issue is @ hand.  Communication is key in being able to rectify anything on a minute scale and most certainly on a larger scale. (Be it personal, state, country, global, etc.)"

Like, we're facing a public health crisis right now, and it's somehow become politicized. The politicization of public health is causing a lot of people to die.//","Let's see, I already mentioned the pandemic in the last question, so I would say, unemployment and income inequality. These issues were already there before the pandemic, but that has sped these problems up. Wages haven't changed, but inflation has gone up, so, what's happening is, what people are taking home isn't enough to live off of.","I would say healthcare is a big problem facing the country. I believe the Affordable Care Act allowed a lot of people to get insurance who previously weren't able to get insured because of pre-existing conditions. However, the Affordable Care Act works best when states have accepted the aid package from the federal government, but a lot of states haven't done it. It's based on a really effective healthcare system that they have in the Netherlands, but in the Netherlands, it's subsidized much more than in the U.S., so because healthcare isn't subsidized as much as in the Netherlands, premiums are much higher for people in the United States; so, while you are able to purchase a healthcare plan, it may be too expensive to use, with expensive premiums and expensive deductibles, and that's a huge problem moving forward.","I would say, polarization, just because it affects all of those other issues.// If congress can't agree on the facts, then it's going to be pretty difficult to address any of the nation's problems. Without bipartisanship, a lot of times, proposed bills won't make it to the Senate floor. I think probably the biggest problem with polarization is probably in the U.S. Senate."
